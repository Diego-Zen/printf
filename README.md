# C - printf
> Create a printf function in C

## _printf
* This project is about making a custom prototype of the function printf, emulating the original one.

## Description in a nutshell
* In C programming language, printf() function is used to print the “character, string, float, integer, octal and hexadecimal values” onto the output screen.

## Description in deep
* printf is the C language function to do formatted printing, in the most simple case, printf takes one argument, a string of characters, for example, so it can be displayed on the screen but the real power of printf is when we are printing the contents of variables, basing on the format promted for display such variable. Every format specification starts with a percent sign "%" and ends with a letter. The letters are chosen to have some mnemonic meaning. Here is a partial list:

```C
%c print a single character
%d print a decimal (base 10) number
%e print an exponential floating-point number
%f print a floating-point number
%g print a general-format floating-point number
%i print an integer in base 10
%o print a number in octal (base 8)
%s print a string of characters
%u print an unsigned decimal (base 10) number
%x print a number in hexidecimal (base 16)
%% print a percent sign (\% also works)
```
